SLEEPING BARBER PROBLEM

Scenario
Consider a barber’s shop where there is only one barber, one barber chair and a number of waiting chairs for the customers.
When there are no customers the barber sits on the barber chair and sleeps.   
 When a customer arrives he awakes the barber or waits in one of the vacant chairs if the barber is cutting someone else’s hair.                              
 When all the chairs are full, the newly arrived customer simply leaves.

Critical Section Problem
There might be a scenario in which the customer ends up waiting on a barber and a barber waiting on the customer, which would result to a deadlock.
Then there might also be a case of starvation when the customers don’t follow an order to cut hair, as some people won’t get a haircut even though they had been waiting long.

A scenario (sequential behavior) of the barber thread is : 
{assertion: no customer is in the barber room} barber waits until a customer is in the waiting room; 
{assertion: met a customer} barber starts cutting the customer's hair; 
 barber finishes the hair cut and informs the customer; 
 barber waits until the customer leaves the barber room. 
A scenario for the customer thread is : 
customer checks if the waiting room is full, if so, leaves, else enters the waiting room 
customer waits until the barber becomes free; 
{assertion: met the barber} customer leaves the waiting room and enters the barber room; 
waits until the barber finishes the hair cut ; 
{assertion: hair cut is done} customer leaves the barber room.
