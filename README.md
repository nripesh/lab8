====Develop a software that will serve as an interactive demonstration (e - learning) of the process synchronization problem using semaphores, busy waiting, spinlocks, monitors, critical section,etc. 
    Develop the software as a group by dividing the problems into modules for the individuals and upload individually into github.
we are doing this  simulation with html and javascript.
In critical section problem when a writer start writin reader can also start reading.
To solve the critical section problem we are using semaphore in which busy waiting and spin lock are shown by when a writer is writing in the shared resource text area reader is keep checking that whether it is free are not
To solve these issus related with semaphore we are using monitor.
